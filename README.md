# Quadruple-Pendulum-Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a 4-point mass pendulum (Quadruple Pendulum). 
Quadpendulum.py: Provides an animated simulation of the quadruple pendulum, allowing users to visualize the dynamic behavior of the system also allow user to edit pendulum properties.
Workspace_pendulum.py: Outputs the coordinates of the pendulum's angles (taking 270 degrees on a unit circle as 0 degrees), specifically for a system with the following initial conditions:
All Leg length: 100
All Mass: 1
All Initial angle: 45 degrees 
No initial angular velocities
